[{"content":"Why you want to do that? This would be the first question if I need a server for this why would I need to expose any service from local in first place?\nOne of the reason would be to reduce server cost, like say you want to do some graphic intensive task which you can do in your local.

Suppose you have a server running on port 8080 and want to expose it to the outside world but you don\u0026rsquo;t have a public IP. So to make it public you need to have a server with public IP running in cloud (or any where) and SSH running in both the mechine. Let say the IP address of the public server is pp.pp.pp.pp then in the private server run the command ssh -NT -o ServerAliveInterval=5 -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -R 80:127.0.0.1:8080 ubuntu@pp.pp.pp.pp\nor to run it through systemd use this systemd file inside /etc/systemd/system/api-tunnel.service\n/etc/systemd/system/api-tunnel.service [Unit] Description=api server tunnel After=network.target StartLimitIntervalSec=0 [Service] Type=simple Restart=always RestartSec=1 User=ubuntu ExecStart=/usr/bin/env ssh -NT -o ServerAliveInterval=5 -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -R 80:127.0.0.1:8080 ubuntu@pp.pp.pp.pp [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target after succesfully running the command if you go the url pp.pp.pp.pp from any browser you will see the website running in port 8080 in your private machine\nalso need to update the sshd config file for the server machine to reduce the latency if the tunnel disconnect\n/etc/ssh/sshd_config ClientAliveInterval 5 ClientAliveCountMax 3 ","permalink":"https://subhashhalder.com/post/host-your-site-without-static-ip-via-server/","summary":"Why you want to do that?
